# Customer Behaviour Analysis

### Project Overview

This project and the data used were part of a case study which can be found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/). It focuses on examining patterns, trends, and factors influencing customer spending to gain insights into their preferences, purchasing habits, and potential areas for improvement in menu offerings or marketing strategies in a dining establishment.

### Background

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so at the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen. Danny’s Diner needs your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from its few months of operation but has no idea how to use its data to help it run the business.

### Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent, and which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally, he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
